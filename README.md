# Discourse Signatures

Felling nostalgic of old VBulletin days? Wanna spam and flame like it's 2000?

**Install Discourse Signatures!**


## Before Installation

Since this is an early MVP the installation process is a bit, complicated.

First you need to create 2 Custom User Fields. This is easy as follow:

- Go to Admin -> Customize -> User Fields

- Make then look like this:

![user_fields](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385470/10153953/ecc5375a-6637-11e5-81a7-727deec3e41a.png)


After this go to Settings -> Users -> `public user custom fields` and add the custom fields who hold sig info, like this:

![public_fields](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385470/10153952/ecc38392-6637-11e5-9353-86e1832c2a1f.png)

PS.: This can change if you have another user fields enabled. Maybe we get to set this by field name someday.


## Installation

Now you proceed with a normal [installation of a plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157?u=falco).


## After Installation

You need to enable the plugins options for all users on Settings -> Plugins:

![options_admin](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385470/10153950/ecaabefc-6637-11e5-8b46-b184512223ce.png)


And each user need to enable and select a signature on his/her profile:

![options_user](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1385470/10153949/eca93abe-6637-11e5-812c-f3439b255a6a.png)


and thats it!
